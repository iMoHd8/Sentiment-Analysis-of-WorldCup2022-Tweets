"# Sentiment-Analysis-of-WorldCup2022-Tweets" 

Using Machine Learning, we developed a system that classifies the hate speech, specifically hate speech of world cup 2022 tweets.
In developing process, we have implemented the dataset on five algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, SVM, and Random Forest).
The best accuracy was "Logistic Regression", so we built the system using it, and the accuracy is 94% on dataset has 430k records. also,
we have tried to avoid "Negation Words" issue by creating a dataset that have a many of negation word and the alternative of each word,
then the system will check if there any negation from the dataset, if yes then the word will be replaced by its alternative.

things we used: Logistic Regression Algorithm NLP tools (stopwords, tokenization, n-gram...) Transfer Learning (BERT) Twitter API Django framework

The system has the ability to fetch tweets from twitter and classify each tweet, either from specific hashtag, or twitter user (public accounts).

and eventually we have developed a website for displaying the results using Django framework.

surely i didn't talk about all our works, but believe me we faced many problems that we used all of our knowledge to fix them.
Eventually this was a graduation project that we have put all our efforts on it. and This is our project in a nutshell.

thanks for your time :)
